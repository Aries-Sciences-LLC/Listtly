This is an easy to use list app. You can organize it through different colors and you can archive it, trash it, and set it complete. And it uses fun little transitions that make it feel better to use.

This app is great for any parents who might want to help their child get into making lists and tasks but don't know where the start. The design was optimized so that children can create the best habit there is out there, at such an early age.
